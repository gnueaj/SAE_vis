    Generate alluvial comparison data between two Sankey configurations.

    **Note: This endpoint is part of Phase 2 development and is not yet fully implemented.**

    This endpoint takes two complete Sankey configurations and returns
    alluvial flow data that shows how the same features are categorized
    differently under different settings. This visualization helps
    researchers understand the consistency (or inconsistency) of their
    explanation and scoring methods.

    The alluvial diagram connects the final nodes of two Sankey diagrams,
    tracking individual features by their feature_id to show how they
    flow between different categories.

    Args:
        request: Comparison request containing two Sankey configurations
        data_service: Data service dependency

    Returns:
        ComparisonResponse: Alluvial flows and consistency metrics

        HTTPException: For various error conditions including invalid configurations,
                      no overlapping features, or server errors
