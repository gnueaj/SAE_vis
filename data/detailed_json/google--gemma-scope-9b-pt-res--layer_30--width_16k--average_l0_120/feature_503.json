Many activations cluster around compound or multi-syllabic words where partial segments (e.g., \\\"mis\\\", \\\"stere\\\", \\\"endos\\\", \\\"cination\\\") are individually significant, suggesting that morphological subunits of complex words are important for semantic interpretation. Additionally, common phrases like \\\"according to\\\", \\\"contrary to\\\", \\\"in the\\\", and \\\"this sort of\\\" frequently appear, indicating that functional and idiomatic expressions are key to contextual understanding.",
